Only one flight was scheduled to operate in this period \\u2014 Delhi-Hong Kong on Monday (September 21) which has been cancelled and passengers informed,\\u201d said a senior AI official.Last month also Hong Kong had barred Air India flights for two weeks after 11 passengers who flew in there from Delhi on August 14 had tested positive on arrival. Cathay Pacific is not operating to India during the pandemic.Chinese media reports Hong Kong has temporarily suspended Cathay Dragon (Cathay\\u2019s regional arm) flights on Kuala Lumpur route. Five people flew AI Express to Malaysia and then took a connecting flight to Hong Kong, where they tested positive on arrival, according to those reports.Last week Dubai aviation authorities had decided to suspend AI Express operations to the city for 15 days after the budget airline twice flew passengers with Covid positive reports there from India. Following an apology from AI Express and assurance that the same will not happen again, Dubai Civil Aviation Authority revoked this suspension.Last Friday, the airline\\u2019s spokesperson had said: \\u201cWe have apologised for the two lapses to Dubai authorities and assured them of putting in place multi-level strict checks to ensure the same does not get repeated. (Accordingly) all AI Express flights from and to Dubai will operate as per original schedule from Saturday (September 19).\\u201d\",\n          \"An edited image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi bowing in front of Chinese President Xi Jinping with folded hands is being shared on social media.
