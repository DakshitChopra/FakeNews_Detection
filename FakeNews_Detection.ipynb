Cathay Pacific is not operating to India during the pandemic.Chinese media reports Hong Kong has temporarily suspended Cathay Dragon (Cathay\\u2019s regional arm) flights on Kuala Lumpur route. Five people flew AI Express to Malaysia and then took a connecting flight to Hong Kong, where they tested positive on arrival, according to those reports.Last week Dubai aviation authorities had decided to suspend AI Express operations to the city for 15 days after the budget airline twice flew passengers with Covid positive reports there from India. Following an apology from AI Express and assurance that the same will not happen again, Dubai Civil Aviation Authority revoked this suspension.Last Friday, the airline\\u2019s spokesperson had said: \\u201cWe have apologised for the two lapses to Dubai authorities and assured them of putting in place multi-level strict checks to ensure the same does not get repeated.
